# Installation 

## Installing the plugin

### From pypi

```sh
pip install mkdocs-test
```

### Locally (Github)

```sh
pip install .
```

Or, to install the test dependencies (for testing _this_ package,
not your MkDocs projects):

```sh
pip install .[test]
```

### Install the pytest framework

This will help you run the tests easily:

```sh
pip install pytest
```
